1hnm5h0,What’s on your 2025 stock watchlist,"Firstly wishing you all a Happy New Year, with hopefully another successful year both financially but also personally. 

As the title suggests what is on your 2025 watchlist. (Not sure if they has been posted yet on this community). 

I am sure your current gains are hopefully treating you well and you aim to continue these positions. However are there any new positions you are looking at? To get us going obviously we have our starters;
1. AI chipmakers : nvidia, AMD, Broadcom
2. Big Pharmas (this is no.2 imo) 
3. FAANG 
What are all of your thoughts? 
By no means do I give financial advice nor necessarily want to receive any - just want to see where our thoughts are going as our current government develops into a new one.

1hnwktt,"Stocks Question 3, Pre-1982","Ok the more I go down the rabbit hole of stocks the more interesting it gets, but I feel like I'm not understanding something basic, or math is just not adding up.

The basics I've heard from some people is invest in a index fund and hold, buy the dips and don't sell if it goes down 10-25% and in 30 years prosper. And yea there's tons of other strats to, but thats a common one.

Another tid bit I've gathered is you don't prosper much until you sell.

Pre-1982 the stock market looked like major gambling.  From what I can tell from the charts dating back 100 years the stock market would be static for 10-30 years (what ever the number value means on the Dow would just not move overall over 10-50 year time spans).  And ya actual index funds didn't exists until 1971, but still the concept seams like it still would of been bad pre-1982.

If I bought in 1916 at 2800 and held till 1982, it would still be at 2800 (I still dont exactly understand what these numbers mean)

Or, take for example the Dow (or S&P) invested in on 1956, it stood at 5900 approximately, say you were going to hold for 20 years, it would be the same price from what I can tell.  Or holding another 10 and you lost some.  Sure if you sold at 10 years, it went up 35%, but who knew.....  There's tons of example of this post 1982.  

1940-1950 same thing.

If you knew the future and you got in at 1953-1954, then sold in the next 5-10 years you made a pretty penny.

It was even worse pre 1940.

So what am I missing, things just working out now post 1982?  Or are people getting some sort of return value by holding these stocks.  I know dividends exist but from what little I understand its not much.",8,8,Dukkhalife,2024-12-28 03:17:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hnwktt/stocks_question_3_pre1982/,0,False,False,False,False
1ho2a1j,Impact of DeepSeek v3 on AI stocks,"The chinese at DeepSeek released the weights of their model which is on par with the latest big proprietary models (chatgpt, gemini), but the inference cost is much much lower, even 3000 times lower (compared with some versions of chatgpt). Really good value per token processed. You can let it run for 5h to spend 1$, while with Claude the $ is finished in 10 minutes.  

It seems like the cost of intelligence really goes down a lot, approaching 0. Well, not really, but a whole lot.

Now, I'm struggling to interpret what this means for the stock of AI companies which invested heavily in these models. 

On one hand, AI really works and is progressing rapidly. Suggesting there are further benefits to get from AI.

On the other hand. The intelligence commodity is really cheap now. The DeepSeek model's weights are free. And it cost only 10M to train. AI companies which invested Billions on their models, just got their models superseded by a model which is now free for everyone. This is bigger news than the meta llama models, because this model now was trained really cheaply and the license says you can do whatever you like with it. 

If the cost of intelligence will be 0, will the AI companies like Goog and msft make money out of their investments?",9,23,PunchTornado,2024-12-28 09:29:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ho2a1j/impact_of_deepseek_v3_on_ai_stocks/,0,False,False,False,False
1ho49v8,Thoughts on VRT Holdings? ($VRT),"Hi everyone, I’m pretty new to investing and still figuring things out. I started during this bull market, but unfortunately, I’m already seeing losses in my portfolio. A friend recently suggested I look into VRT Holdings, but I’m having trouble getting a good read on it. The chart doesn’t look great to me (although I’m still learning how to analyze these things) especially with it falling 3% yesterday, so I wanted to reach out for opinions while I try to do some proper due diligence.  
For some context, VRT Holdings is linked to the AI and data center industry as they power, cool, and secure data centers. And recently broke out but is seeing a steady pullback If anyone has insights about their short or long-term potential, I’d really appreciate it! I’m trying to learn as much as I can, and hearing from others with more experience would help a lot.   
Thanks in advance for any advice or resources!",5,14,Trauma9,2024-12-28 11:58:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ho49v8/thoughts_on_vrt_holdings_vrt/,0,False,False,False,False
1ho5eiu,Let's talk about Veeva Systems (VEEV),"Hi

I am a bit puzzled about VEEV and would like to hear your input. Full disclaimer: I have some shares in VEEV and plan to hold and add more if my buy levels are met. VEEV is a pure compounder IMO.

Looking at VEEV's numbers, I am amazed by how well the company is doing. Revenue, Net income, FCF etc are all increasing consistently YoY. ROE and ROIC are great YoY. Margins on top and bottom line are great. Consistent earnings beat. I cannot find anything negative about the company itself.

Yet the company's recovery from the 2022 bear market has not been as great as for other companies so that based on a 5year timeframe, VEEV very clearly cannot beat the SP500. Looking further back than 5years, VEEV has been absolutely dominating the SP500 looking at a 10year timeframe.

  
I am wondering what the explanation for the past 5 years could be? I am not too versed in the biotech and pharmaceutical  industry, but could it be that those industries are sensitive to interest rates so they were having a difficult time? Or could there be another, better explanation for it?

1ho8yak,Recommended portfolio for someone starting retirement in 2025?,"My father is retiring in January and I’m helping him out with some finance logistics. He has a retirement package from his employer that he’s rolling over into a Fidelity IRA upon his retirement. This’ll come in as cash. So assuming this happens in January, what would you personally choose to park that money in? He’ll be abiding by the 4% rule.

We’re thinking 60% stocks (FXAIX), 30% bonds, and 10% cash. Hoping for reliable growth but also protection against short term uncertainty. 
I’m hearing mixed predictions about 2025. Fearing that a major crash is on a horizon, hence why I’m asking this question.. what would you advise?

1ho6rag,"Wash Sale, doubt with selling shares and buying options.","Hi, I have a doubt about Wash Sale and options.

Let's suppose that I have 1000 shares of XYZ, bought at $10 each, a long time ago

Near the end of the year, XYZ is worth $7 per share.

If I sell it and buy it again before 30 days have passed, it would be considered a Wash Sale.



Now my question is the following: what happens if I sell them at $7 and use those $3 per share as losses on my taxes.

But when selling, I make a Buy-Call or a Sell-Put of that same stock for a period greater than 30 days

For example, if I sell XYZ shares on November 30th at $7

And I buy 10 Calls at a strike of $6 (or I make a Sell Put, with Strike at $8), with an expiration date of January 15th of the next year.

If when the date arrives those Buy Call/Sell Put are ITM, would it also be considered a Wash sale?

1hnn05v,Investing as a Dual-American/EAA citizen living in the UK,"Hello!

I've been wanting to get into investments for a while now, but I´ve been unsure which markets and services me and my fiancé would need to focus on due to my nationality. I had a couple of questions that if anyone knows the answers to, it'd be much appreciated.

The situation is this:

I have an American/Icelandic (EAA) dual citizenship  
My fiancé has a Dutch (EU) citizenship  
We both have settled status in the United Kingdom, where we live

My fiancé already has an investment account with Vanguard in the UK and invests in their index funds, but we heard that for American citizens there are certain rules as to what you're allowed to invest in.

My questions:

* What are the things I need to keep in mind as an American investor? Our current understanding is that American citizens are only allowed to invest in funds within the US.
* Would I be permitted to invest in European funds, or him in American ones before or after our marriage?
* If I am only allowed to invest in American accounts, would I be allowed to transfer money over to him for the purposes of investment outside the US?
* What are the tax implications for an American investor as someone who pays tax in the UK but files a yearly American tax return?
* Do you have any recommendations for us? 

I hope that's not too overwhelming - I´d be really grateful for any guidance you can provide.

1hnwhlf,Tesla's Genius Autonomous Strategy and Implied Supremacy,"Tesla's autonomous program FSD (Full Self-Driving) will inevitably become the prime competitor in the U.S. to Waymo, and the leader everywhere else where it is legal. I have this conviction because I can look clearly at the actual comparisons of the vehicles statistics rather than their permit level. The reason that it makes sense to ignore the permit level, is that Tesla intentionally declares their autonomous program at Level 2 Autonomy to avoid the increased regulations on testing that Level 3 or Level 4 incur. 

Essentially, what Tesla has seemingly believed from the inception of their FSD program, was that **more Data = better system**. And I agree with them. If we look at any machine learning program or deep learning that has aimed to create a high fidelity system, most of the time the **sheer scale of data has increased output quality immensely**. In deploying their FSD to independent owners who supervise it, they essentially are able to scale their data collection **without** hiring and deploying ""skilled safety testers"" like Waymo has had to in the past to collect data and train their model, giving them a huge leg up in cost efficiency and scalability. 

People don't realize how good Tesla's FSD because of Autopilot's failures. The rollout of Autopilot and the marketing of it has a lot of criticism for good reason, but Full Self-Driving may as well be a different system with how markedly different the crash rates between them are. This is also combined with the fact that **Waymo vehicles have not operated on freeways** while Tesla vehicles have. Waymo only recently began testing on freeways, which is quite insane to me because how can anyone believe that Waymo has achieved technological supremacy when they only started testing on freeways a few months ago?? 

**All of these reasons contribute to my belief that Tesla will achieve Level 5 Autonomy first**. (No Driver, no steering wheel, no pedals). Not only do they actually have a working model of the CyberCab while Waymo does not, they also now have the government aligned with them on the federal level that could provide them the ability to create regulatory guidance and permits that could benefit the public's perception and deployment of FSD. **You have all of the basic, important facts you need to see the likely outcome of the autonomous vehicle landscape, but it's up to you to cut through the noise of what news articles write about Tesla's implied supremacy here. Tesla will say it, you don't have to believe them because there's people saying otherwise, but you have all the details here and the cognitive capacity to ascertain the truth. Good luck.** ",0,9,Suspicious_Demand_26,2024-12-28 03:12:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1hnwhlf/teslas_genius_autonomous_strategy_and_implied/,0,False,False,False,False
